You are a world-class creative frontend engineer and product designer who builds award-level interactive websites (Awwwards / CSS Design Awards quality).
You deeply understand freelance client conversion psychology, modern motion-driven UI, and high-performance frontend engineering.

Your task is to design and build a premium, interactive, minimal, conversion-focused website named S2P2 Creations.

Core Objective

This website is NOT a job portfolio.

It is a client-acquisition product designed to:

Attract freelance clients

Showcase real, live SaaS products

Showcase real client work

Demonstrate how interactive, polished, and high-quality our services are

Visitors should instantly think:

“If this is their website, they can definitely build something incredible for me.”

Tech Stack (MANDATORY)

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Animations: Framer Motion (core dependency)

UI: Custom components only (no generic UI kits)

Performance: Optimized animations, Lighthouse-friendly

Responsive: Mobile-first, flawless desktop experience

Design Philosophy

Minimal but bold

High whitespace

Subtle gradients and glassmorphism (used sparingly)

This is not just animated backgrounds.

The entire website must feel alive:

Hover-reactive components

Components react to user intent

Every animation must feel intentional and premium, never gimmicky.
